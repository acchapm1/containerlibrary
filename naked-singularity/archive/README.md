# Archive

This directory archives all of the older, system-specific, Singularity 
2.x-era container definition files that were created as part of the
naked-singularity project during its first few years of existance. It
also stores a copy of the original naked-singularity.sh helper script.
Neither the original helper script, nor the definitions files stored 
within this directory will be updated again. As such, they should not be
used in any production workloads moving forward, unless absolutely 
necessary. They are stored here simply to serve as a historical 
reference for the time being.
